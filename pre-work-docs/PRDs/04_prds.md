# LaunchPad — PRDs Index

This directory contains standalone Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

Each PRD:
- Is scoped to a single feature area
- Defines behavior unambiguously
- Acts as a contract for implementation

## MVP PRDs
1. PRD 01 — Agent Studio
2. PRD 02 — Agent Brain
3. PRD 03 — Meeting Runtime
4. PRD 04 — Artifact Generation
5. PRD 05 — RBAC

Each PRD must be completed before advancing scope.
