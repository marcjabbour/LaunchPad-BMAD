## Purpose
This document instructs AI-based development tools on how to interpret and implement LaunchPad.

---

## Sources of Truth
- Product Vision defines intent
- System Architecture defines structure
- PRDs define exact behavior
- Execution Plan defines scope and priority

---

## Mandatory Rules
- Do not invent features
- Do not exceed PRD scope
- Do not collapse services
- Ask for clarification if ambiguous

---

## Code Guidelines
- Modular architecture
- Explicit state management
- Clear service boundaries
- Strong typing where possible
- No hidden side effects

---

## MVP Constraints
- No autonomy beyond PRDs
- No cross-org data access
- No irreversible deletes
