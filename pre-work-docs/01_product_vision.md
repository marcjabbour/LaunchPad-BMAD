# LaunchPad — Product Vision

## TL;DR
LaunchPad is an Agent Operations Platform that allows organizations to configure, onboard, govern, and deploy AI agents into live meetings where real work happens. These agents collaborate with humans and with each other, generate real-time artifacts, and persist institutional knowledge in a controlled, auditable system.

LaunchPad is not a chatbot. It is workforce infrastructure for AI teammates.

## Problem Statement

### Where work actually happens
Most meaningful work happens in meetings:
- Product decisions
- Client alignment
- Architecture discussions
- Design reviews
- Planning and retrospectives

Yet meetings are:
- Ephemeral
- Poorly captured
- Context-fragmenting

### Why existing AI tools fail
Current AI tools:
- Live outside meetings (chat tabs, docs, side tools)
- Lack persistent organizational memory
- Cannot be governed or audited
- Do not understand roles, culture, or authority
- Are stateless across conversations

The result: AI is helpful, but never trusted with real responsibility.

---

## Vision

LaunchPad turns AI into **first-class teammates**.

Organizations should be able to:
- Create AI agents with specific roles (PM, Designer, Engineer)
- Onboard them like employees
- Control what they know and how they behave
- Deploy them directly into meetings
- Audit and evolve them over time

LaunchPad becomes the place companies go to:
> Hire, train, manage, and deploy AI coworkers.

## Core Principles

1. **Meetings are the primary interface**
2. **Agents are roles, not prompts**
3. **Memory must be explicit and editable**
4. **Humans remain in control**
5. **Everything is auditable**

## Product Pillars

### 1. Agent Studio
A control center where agents are created and managed.

Admins can configure:
- Role and responsibilities
- Personality and tone
- Voice
- Tool permissions
- Speaking and interruption rules
- Knowledge scope (Org / Project / Private)

Agents are versioned and deployable.

---

### 2. Agent Onboarding
Agents learn through controlled ingestion:
- Uploaded documents
- Structured onboarding interviews
- Meeting transcripts
- Human-approved notes

Admins can inspect, edit, redact, or remove knowledge at any time.

---

### 3. Live Meeting Deployment
Agents can be invited into live meetings where they:
- Listen continuously
- Decide when to speak
- Collaborate with humans via side channels
- Suggest adding other agents
- Generate real-time artifacts

All actions are governed by policy and approvals.

---

### 4. Artifact Persistence
Agents generate:
- Documents
- Diagrams
- Summaries
- Action items
- Visuals

Artifacts are:
- Persisted automatically
- Linked to meetings, agents, and projects
- Permissioned and auditable
- Searchable across the org

## Differentiation

| Traditional AI | LaunchPad |
|--------------|-----------|
| Stateless | Persistent |
| Prompt-based | Role-based |
| Ungoverned | Auditable |
| Chat-centric | Meeting-centric |
| Disposable output | Institutional memory |

## Walkthrough Example (Enhanced)

Marc provisions LaunchPad for MyPetHub.

Agents:
- Alex — Product Manager
- Sarah — UI/UX Designer
- Raj — Backend Architect

Users:
- Carl (Admin)
- Andrew (Engineer)

### Onboarding
Carl uploads product docs and runs onboarding calls.
LaunchPad transcribes, extracts knowledge, and links sources.

Carl inspects Raj’s knowledge and removes deprecated architecture details.

### Live Client Call
Carl invites Alex into a client call.
Alex listens silently, generates a roadmap diagram, and answers product questions.
Alex suggests adding Sarah.
Carl approves.
Sarah joins and generates UI concepts.

All artifacts are persisted automatically.

### Post-Meeting
Carl reviews sources Alex used and redacts speculative content.
LaunchPad stores the meeting as durable organizational knowledge.

## Long-Term Vision
LaunchPad becomes the operating system for AI workforces:
- On-demand specialists
- Agent marketplaces
- Cross-org collaboration
- Compliance-ready AI operations
